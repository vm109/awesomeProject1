# Sorting Algorithms

## bubble-sort
  
  - Bubble sorting will compare the present number with the previous number 
  - And bubble sort will bubble the unsorted numbers
  - Time complexity of bubble sort is o(n^2)

## Insertion sort 

   - insertion sort is simple sort
   - values from unsorted array are inserted into the sorted array
   - Time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2)
