1. A tree is called `height balanced` if the no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf.
2. Different balancing schemes have different definitions to say if a leaf node is farther. 
3. one such definition is: 
   1. left subtree of a node is balanced 
   2. right subtree of a node is balanced
   3. the difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is no more than 1
   This definition of height balancing is used in AVL trees.
