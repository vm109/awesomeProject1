1. What is a Graph? 
   A Graph is a set of nodes. And there are relations between nodes. 
2. What is vertices in graph? 
   ans. A node or vertex in a graph is the center piece of the graph. It holds the data or value of the node.
3. What is a edge in graph?
   ans. A edge is the connection between two nodes in a graph. 
       if (u,v) is the edge then u is the node1 and v is node2
       (u,v) is not same as (v,u) in directed graph since nodes in directed graph should be ordered. 
4. What is the degree of a node? 
    ans. The number of nodes incident on a node, i.e how many edges are emerging from a node is the degree of the node
         In a directed graph there are 2 types of degree. 
           1. indegree i.e the number of edges arriving a node.
           2. outdegree i.e the number of edges departing a node.
5. What are the types of graphs? 
   ans. There are directed and undirected graphs
        directed graph: there are 2 types 
                         a. Directed acyclic graph [DAG]
                         b. Tree: Tree is a form of graph with restriction. i.e a node can have only one child.
        undirected graph: there are 3 types of undirected graph
                         a. Connected Graph: i.e every pair of nodes in a connected graph has `PATH` [ not edge but path]
                         b. Complete Graph: all pairs of nodes in a graph will have connected edge. i.e every u is adjacent
                            to every other v in a given graph.
                         c. BiConnected Graph: 
6. What is graph terminology? 
   Adjacency: In graph two vertices or nodes are said to be adjacent if there is a connection/edge (u,v) between them
7. What is Degree of graph vertex? 
   The number of nodes connected to node or the number of edges coming out of a node is called degree.
