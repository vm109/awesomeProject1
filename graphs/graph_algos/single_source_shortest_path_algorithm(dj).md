## Dijkstra's Algorithm 
Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm - 

If a weighted graph is given we need to find the shortest path for each vertex. 

Finding the shortest path is a minimization problem. [minimization problems are also called as optimization problem]

optimization problems can be solved by using greedy method. 


Single-Source shortest path algorithm is greedy algorithm
[Dijkstra's algorithm may fail when there are negative weights in the graph]
